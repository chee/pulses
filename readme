pulses - jack analog sync

   git clone https://github.com/chee/pulses
   cd pulses
   make
   ./pulses

then connect pulses:2ppqn to the input of your po, starfish or volca

if you want the clock to play even if the transport is not active pass the -t
argument

most of the code is ripped off from jack_metro but the wave is hand-crafted and
it gets the bpm from the transport

*T*O*D*O*
  • add a midi output for midi devices to connect to
  • add more outputs at different ppqn (or make ppqn configurable with arg)
  • it probably needs to skip back to 0 when the transport resets because i bet
    right now it will not do the click right when you press play if you paused
    in between clicks
