pulses - jack analog sync

	git clone https://git.snoot.club/chee/pulses
	cd pulses
	make
	./pulses

then connect pulses:2ppqn to the input of your po, starfish or volca

if you want the clock to play even if the transport is not active pass the -t
argument

most of the code is ripped off from jack_metro but the wave is hand-crafted and
it gets the bpm from the transport
